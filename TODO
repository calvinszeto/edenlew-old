I need to learn a few things:
    Cargo Collective custom handlers/views/helpers/etc.
    Handlebars
    Backbone

The plan for learning these things:
    Q+A style notes - how do I do this? -> answer
        When I get to writing my own code, I will do this in the form of TDD
    Reading the annotated example
    Handlebars and Backbone tutorial

Also, need to set up some workflow:
    A build file that sets up the stuff specified in the README
        Coffeescript compiler
        Javascript minifier
        Flatten directories (probably bash)
        Concatenate files (probably bash)
    Testing, preferably TDD
        Jasmine and Karma
        Will be difficult w/ Backbone and Handlebars, but give it a shot
        Will be impossible to test locally without mocking out Cargo custom stuff
    Pushing to production
        Basically just calling sftp and copying over all files. Really, this can be done manually because it's only a couple commands, but automation is always nice
